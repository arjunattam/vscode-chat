2.  Generate a [Slack legacy token](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)
3.  Add the token to your settings (File/Code > Preferences > Settings)

```json
{
  "chat.slack.legacyToken": "xoxp-2854..."
}
```

### Integrated with VS Live Share

Type `/live share` in your message box to start a VS Live Share session. This will send the invitation link to the channel. When you're done, type `/live end` to end.

### Native Look-and-feel

Slack Chat fits in natively with VSCode, with dark and light themes. Place it within vertical/horizontal window splits, just like your editor.
