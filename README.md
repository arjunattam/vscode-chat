# Features

- **Quiet notifications**: System notifications for chat can be painful, and this extension implements a subtle unread count instead.
- **Rich formatting**: Support for markdown code snippets, emojis, message reactions, and threads.
- **Native look-and-feel**: Use your dark theme and grid editor layout preferences with chat.

# VS Live Share

## Companion chat

Team Chat is a light-weight companion chat for [VS Live Share](https://aka.ms/vsls), without any dependency on an existing backend like Slack or Discord.

To chat with your session peers, start a new session, and click the `Chat` status bar item. Optionally, you can also run the `Chat with VS Live Share participants` command.

The [VS Live Share Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) includes the VS Live Share and Team Chat extensions for an easy one-click installation.

## With Slack and Discord

Optionally, you can also set up your Slack or Discord account to continuing using the same chat provider during a Live Share session.

With Slack/Discord, you can also start a new session with online team members easily. You can also use the slash commands `/live share` and `/live end` to start or end sessions in a chat window.
